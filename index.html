                <p class="self"> Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Marshall, 
                    I am a graduate of Mount St. Mary&apos;s University who is seeking to bolster my skill pool with 
                    full stack coding. I was born and raised in Maryland with many trips where I got to explore 
                    most of the continental United States. While I&apos;ve never left the North American continent, I 
                    have had the opportunity to visit Canada and Mexico, unfortunately not getting to experience 
                    much of either however. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy a large variety of activities ranging most common fields of interest. Outdoors 
                    I enjoy swimming, snowboarding, and hiking, while inside activities include drawing, coding, 
                    and video games. My favorite foods are steak, salmon, and pasta while my favorite beverages 
                    include milk and sprite. Finally, my guilty pleasure is sitting down to watch twitch in the 
                    evenings when I have the time.
